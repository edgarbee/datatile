                It's with pleasure that I endorse the DataTile Team. They did a great job in building a custom portal with excellent functionality. The team was responsive, helpful and a pleasure to work with. I would certainly use them again for any future needs.

                    DataTile is exactly the tool for our client that we were looking for. We use DataTile since 2015. With that tool, we are able to provide up-to-date figures to a broader audience on a client side. DataTile meets the customer expectations (fast access to relevant data), and therefore we received very positive feedback from the client. Additionally, we appreciate the continuous professional support provided by the DataTile team developing the tool further.

                    World Poll is the largest-scaled study in the world - big data with huge geographical coverage. I used this great interactive presentation portal made by DataTile team to demonstrate the migration potential of 165 countries that are included in our study.
